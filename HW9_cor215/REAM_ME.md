## Task 1

I worked with Jon and Dana. They were both helpful with collapsing the data cube and abstracting the insight needed for event dection. Tohether we cleaned the data cube, cretated a for loop to plot all time series, and came to the conclusion that the drop in ridership was due to Hurricane sady.

## Task 2
