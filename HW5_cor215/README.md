<b>Assignment 1 and 2</b>

For these first two assignments I worked with Jon Toy, Bailey Griswold, Dana K., and Adrian Dahlin. 
For the most part, I felt these two assignments were fun to do and relevant to my career interest. A special recognition for Jon who explained all the statistical test to our work/study group.

<b>Assignment 3</b>

I worked alone. This assingment in particular was helpful in poslishing my hypothesis formulating skills. 



****
Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formula for the 4 experiments below:

<b>1.
Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.</b>

a = 0.05

H0: Diets do not help loose fat MORE than exercise
H1: Diest do help loos fat MORE than excercise

H0: Mean fat in people who diet and excercise is >= mean fat in people who dont diet and excercise
H1: Mean fat in people who diet and excercise is < mean fat in people who dont diet and excercise

<b>2.
Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.</b>

a = 0.05

H0: the percent of Americans who trust the president in the poll is >= the the percent of Americans who trust the president in the general population
H1: the percent of Americans who trust the president in the poll is < the the percent of Americans who trust the president in the general population

H0: %yes in polls >= %yes in general pop
H1: %yes in polls < %yes in general pop

<b>3.
Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.</b>

a = 0.05

H0: the rate of cessation for necotine patch is <= the rate of cessation for the placebo patch
H1: the rate of cessation for necotine patch is > the rate of cessation for the placebo patch

H0: cessation_rate_necotine <= cessation_rate_placebo
H1: cessation_rate_necotine > cessation_rate_placebo

<b>4.
Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.</b>

a = 0.05

H0: The average IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 are <= the average IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 with mother that smoke during their pregnancy
H1: The average IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 are > the average IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 with mother that smoke during their pregnancy

H0: Mean IQ of children without smoking mothers <= the mean IQ of children with mothers who smoke during pregnancy
H1: Mean IQ of children without smoking mothers > the mean IQ of children with mothers who smoke during pregnancy
