Assignment 1 and 2

For these first two assignments I worked with Jon Toy, Bailey Griswold, Dana K., and Adrian Dahlin. 
For the most part, I felt these two assignments were fun to do and relevant to my career interest. A special recognition for Jon who explained all the statistical test to our work/study group.

Assignment 3

I worked alone. This assingment in particular was helpful in poslishing my hypothesis formulating skills.
