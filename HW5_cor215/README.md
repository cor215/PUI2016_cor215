Assignment 1 and 2

For these first two assignments I worked with Jon Toy, Bailey Griswold, Christian Rosado, and Adrian Dahlin. 
For the most part, I felt these two assignments were fun to do and relevant to my career interest. A special recognition for John who explained all the statistical test to our group.
