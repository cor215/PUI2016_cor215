# ASSIGNMENT 1
For assignment 1, I worked with Baily, Jon, Enrique, and Dana. I realy enjoyed customising the different plots. This was great practice for our lecture on visualization. I learned how to change the figure size, font size, work with different colors, and make presentable graphs. I can see myself specializing in data visualization at the cusp program. 

# ASSIGNMENT 2
For assignment 2, I worked with Jon Toy, Tyler Woebkenberg, and Dana K. We posted a summary of our results of the citibike investigation as an Authorea collaborative document on: https://www.authorea.com/users/105835/articles/133675/_show_article
