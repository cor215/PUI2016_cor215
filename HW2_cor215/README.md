Hello Professor Federica,

Thanks for sending out a group list. This will be very helpful moving forward. I am a working student and would like to take advantage of a working group on weekends. 

I work during the week from 8 am to 4 pm except for Tuesdays when I am in your class. If possible, I would like an extension for this week's assignment. I completed the first portion of the assignment but had trouble with the second half. I can only make your office hours on Tuesdays after class since I have a class Monday nights from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm.

Is this ok?
